A full-stack social networking platform for sharing exercise content, featuring user authentication, content uploads, and interactive elements like likes and comments. I built RESTful APIs using Express and structured the app following the MVC architecture. EJS is used for server-side rendering, with selected interactive features — such as the like button — implemented using React and embedded via CDN. Authentication is handled with Passport, and I implemented full CRUD functionality while applying essential HTTP principles such as routing, status codes, and middleware.
